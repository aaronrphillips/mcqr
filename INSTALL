This document describes the generic installation procedure for Mcqueuer.

Before starting the build/install procedure we recommend you read all
the installation instructions before you proceed. You may need root
or sudo privileges to install the prerequisites and/or the Mcqueuer software.


The installation procedure:
  1. Prerequisites
  2. Download Mcqueuer
  3. Configure
  4. Build
  5. Install


1. Prerequisites:

   a. SSH access, using public keys, to any nodes that mcqr will be connecting
      to during execution. Note that it is possible to run mcqr only on one node
      if this is not an option

   b. C++ compiler

     This software requires a c++11-compliant compiler (tested with gcc-4.8.2)

  a. zeromq (http://download.zeromq.org/)

     This software has been tested with zeromq 4.0.3. You must install 
     this version or newer in order to run Mcqueuer.

       wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-4.0.3.tar.gz
       cd zeromq-4.0.3/
       ./configure --prefix=[path to zeromq install]
       make 
       make install

     Make sure that zeromq libraries are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[path to zeromq install]/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  c. zeromq C++ bindings (https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq)

     This software has been tested with the cppzmq bindings, as of commit 
     6c17af2.

      wget https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq/archive/6c17af22b72c860c30adbfa9cd68a701ba9aeb4f.zip -O cppzmq.zip
      unzip cppzmq.zip
      mv cppzmq-* [path to cppzmq install]

  d. SIGAR library (support.hyperic.com)

     This software has been tested with version 1.6.4.

      wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/sigar/files/sigar/1.6/hyperic-sigar-1.6.4.zip/download -O sigar.zip
      unzip sigar.zip
      mv hyperic-sigar-1.6.4 [path to sigar install]

     Make sure that sigar libraries are in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[path to sigar install]/sigar-bin/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH


2. Download Mcqueuer

   More than likely you have already done this to read this file or
   you are reading it online.

   a. Assuming the file you downloaded is called mcqr-M_m_u.tar.gz
      where M_m_u is the Major, minor, and micro version of the software.
      tar zxf mcqr-M_m_u.tar.gz
      cd mcqr-M_m_u


3. Configure:

   b. You must have the path to where the zeromq headers and libraries are
      installed

   c. Type the command:
      ./configure --with-zeromq=[path to zeromq install] --with-sigar=[path to sigar install] --with-cppzmq=[path to cppzmq install]

      NOTE: If you do not supply the --prefix option, the Mcqueuer binary
            will try to install itself in /usr/local/bin

   d. If everything is correct you should not get any errors. If you get
      output that has errors, then you more than likely do not have
      zeromq installed correctly or are trying this on a different platform 
      that has not been tested.  If the problem is a new platform and you 
      get it to work, please send your fix to the AUTHORS.


4. Build

   a. Type the command:
      make
      NOTE: If you have multiple cores and GNU make, you can type:
      make -j N
      where N is the number of cores you have.

   b. If everything is correct you should not get any errors. If you get
      output that has errors, then you more than likely trying this on a
      different platform that has not been tested. If the problem is a
      new platform and you get it to work, please send your fix to the
      AUTHORS.

   c. Finally, you must add an included library to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      in order to run. Do the following (replace $MCQR_HOME with the
      path to the directory where you extracted Mcqueuer):

          LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[path to zeromq install]/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH=[path to sigar install]/sigar-bin/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          export LD_LIBRARY_PATH


5. Install

   a. Type the command:
      make install

      NOTE: This will install the mcqr binary in /usr/local/bin or 
            the directory you specified with the --prefix option when
            you ran the ./configure command in step 3 above.

   b. If you get output errors, they are probably because you do not have
      permissions to install the software.

  c. Finally, you will need to ensure that all LD_LIBRARY_PATH modifications
     described above are performed at login on any nodes that mcqr will be
     connecting to during execution.

If you make it to this point, then you have successfully installed the
Mcqueuer software and are ready to start exploring your own data sets.
